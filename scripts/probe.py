Two tasks over the same checks. `generate` puts real prompts from the benchmark
through a model and prints what came back. `judge` puts twelve fixtures with
known answers through the classifier and reports whether it agreed.

    Environment  node, GPU, compute capability, driver, library versions
    Cache        whether the weights are on disk, complete, and small enough
    Load         whether they fit, and how long they take to come up
    Run          the task, timed, with the output printed in full
    Estimate     what a full pass would take in wall clock at that rate

Run the small model first. A first attempt at a seventy billion parameter model
fails for one of six reasons and the error will not say which, so prove the
environment on something that loads in a minute and only then change --model.

Nothing is written into results/adaptation/ or results/judgements/, so a real
pass is untouched. The report goes to results/probe/.
